export const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Who is Scholars Cafe for?",
    a: "Scholars Cafe is for Bangladeshi students at any stage of the study abroad journey — from those just exploring options to students actively applying. We work with grades 9–12 and gap year students, and we also support parents who want to understand the process alongside their children.",
  },
  {
    q: "What countries do you support applications for?",
    a: "Our primary expertise is USA university admissions. We also support UK, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, New Zealand, Hungary, South Korea, Turkey, and Spain. If you have a specific country not on this list, reach out — we can often still help.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Full Scholarship Track and who should apply?",
    a: "Our flagship program for students targeting need-based or merit-based scholarships at elite universities, particularly in the USA. It is best suited for students with a strong academic profile (GPA 3.5+ or equivalent) and demonstrated financial need, aiming for universities that meet 100% of demonstrated need — including liberal arts colleges and Ivy League schools.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between the CSS Profile and ISFAA?",
    a: "Both are financial aid application forms used by US universities. The CSS Profile (College Scholarship Service) is used by 400+ institutions and collects detailed family financial information. The ISFAA is an alternative used by institutions that don't require the CSS Profile. We guide students through both forms completely.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a strong SAT score to apply to US universities?",
    a: "Many top US universities have moved to test-optional policies, but a strong SAT score (1450+) significantly strengthens applications and may be required for merit scholarships. We recommend all students preparing for US applications to take the SAT.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which English proficiency test should I take — IELTS, TOEFL, or DET?",
    a: "It depends on your target countries and universities. IELTS is widely used for UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. TOEFL is preferred by many US universities. The DET is the most affordable and convenient and is accepted by 5,000+ institutions. During your free consultation, we help you decide.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Scholars Cafe charge for its services?",
    a: "Pricing depends on the services you select. Individual services are priced separately, and full program tracks are quoted based on your specific needs. Full transparency — you'll always know exactly what you're paying for. Book a free consultation to walk through all options with no pressure.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I start working with Scholars Cafe?",
    a: "The earlier the better. Ideally, students should begin US applications in Grade 11 or early Grade 12 (August–September). For scholarship-focused tracks, starting in Grade 10 gives time to build extracurriculars and prepare for tests. Even if you're already in Grade 12, we can still help — contact us immediately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you help with visa applications?",
    a: "Yes. After receiving your acceptance letter, we guide you through document preparation, DS-160, interview preparation, financial documentation, and SEVIS fee payment. You walk into your visa appointment with full confidence.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I reach you on WhatsApp?",
    a: "Absolutely. WhatsApp is our primary communication channel — +880 1560-001325. Our team responds within 24 hours on weekdays.",
